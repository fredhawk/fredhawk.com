import Pen from '../../../components/Pen.astro';

<div class="w-4/5 mx-auto">
  <img
    src="../../assets/cssgrid_example.gif"
    alt="CSS Grid Example"
    class="w-full"
  />
</div>

The magic to make it act that way is the two css lines below.

```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr));
```

<br />

Put this on the parent container and this will give you a responsive grid that adapts the columns with the size of the container.

<br />
Here is the whole code example to check out.

<Pen user="ozinon" slug="rNVradR" penTitle="Responsive grid" />
