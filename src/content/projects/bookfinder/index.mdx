A React project to search for books through use of Google Books API. Project made to settle my own curiosity about Parcel and setting up a project with automated testing, linting and code style upon committing to git.

<div class="w-64 mx-auto my-4 md:float-right md:ml-4 md:mt-5">
  <Image
    src={results}
    alt="Book search results"
  />
</div>
<br />
The biggest challenge on this project was to set it up with automation on the things I wanted. Setting each up wasn't that difficult but getting them to work together was not straight forward. To solve that issue I used tools like Husky and lint-staged that glued them together and made them work together.
<div class="w-64 mx-auto my-4 md:float-left md:mt-5">
  <Image src={details} alt="Book details" />
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
