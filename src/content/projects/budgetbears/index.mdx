A home expense tracking app where you can track multiple accounts. It is built with ReactJS and Redux on the frontend and NodeJS on the backend.

<div class="w-64 mx-auto my-4 md:float-right md:ml-4 md:mt-5">
  <Image src={dashboard} alt="Dashboard" />
</div>

Making a timeline charts over the transactions with different accounts and purchase categories was solved by having a chart with the total balance of all the accounts.

Making the creation of an account a transaction in and of itself helped a lot. That also solved a problem we had with how to handle account creations in relation to transactions on the backend. At first account creation had no record or relation to transactions which proved a problem with initial balance of the account.

<div class="w-64 mx-auto my-4 md:float-left md:mr-4 md:mt-5">
  <Image
    src={transaction}
    alt="Transaction"
  />
</div>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
