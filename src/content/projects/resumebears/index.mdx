A tool to easily edit and build upon for a resume using Vue and Vuetify. Inspired by and works with jsonresume.org. Trying out Vue for the first time was fun.

<Image src={form} alt="Resume form" />

The greatest challenge was to style and export to PDF which we solved through using native CSS printing styles rather than using JavaScript to do it.

<Image src={template} alt="PDF template" />
