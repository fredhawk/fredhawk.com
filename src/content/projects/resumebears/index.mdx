A tool to easily edit and build upon for a resume using Vue and Vuetify. Inspired by and works with jsonresume.org. Trying out Vue for the first time was fun.

<div class="w-64 mx-auto my-4 md:float-right md:ml-4 md:mt-0">
  <Image src={form} alt="Resume form" />
</div>
<br />
The greatest challenge was to style and export to PDF which we solved through using native CSS printing styles rather than using JavaScript to do it.
<br />
<div class="w-64 mx-auto my-4 md:float-left md:mt-12">
  <Image
    src={template}
    alt="PDF template"
  />
</div>
<br />
<div class="clearfix"></div>
