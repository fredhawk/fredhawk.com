A React project to search for books through use of Google Books API. Project made to settle my own curiosity about Parcel and setting up a project with automated testing, linting and code style upon committing to git.

The biggest challenge on this project was to set it up with automation on the things I wanted. Setting each up wasn't that difficult but getting them to work together was not straight forward. To solve that issue I used tools like Husky and lint-staged that glued them together and made them work together.
