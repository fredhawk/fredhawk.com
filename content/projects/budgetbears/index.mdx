A home expense tracking app where you can track multiple accounts. It is built with ReactJS and Redux on the frontend and NodeJS on the backend.

Making a timeline charts over the transactions with different accounts and purchase categories was solved by having a chart with the total balance of all the accounts.

Making the creation of an account a transaction in and of itself helped a lot. That also solved a problem we had with how to handle account creations in relation to transactions on the backend. At first account creation had no record or relation to transactions which proved a problem with initial balance of the account.
